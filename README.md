How the webpage works?
The idea is simple. The user can register. During registration you need to enter these fields:

Email
Name
Password: it is checked to match, must be at least 6 symbols long and is hashed after checks are done
Checkbox for what type of user you will be (student or teacher)
Student registration allows you to access student dashboard, where you can see created homework. Entering the homework you can upload a file. Once the teacher grades and reviews your submission it will appear instead of .


# Details
My Final project is a website that allows the user to register and schedule indiviudal basketball training sessions.

Also allows the Coach to use the website as Admin and see all the registrants and all the schedules that users signed up for.

Sessions
The webpage uses sessions to confirm that user is registered. Once the user logins, his credentials are checked. Once everything passes a session is created in flask session (serialized and deserialized) and stored in the cookies. The server attaches user to subsequent requests, so the back-end can easily access the details, like roles: student, teacher.

Database
Database stores all users, admin, schedules. The tables, uses foreign keys to relate users to submitted schedules.
